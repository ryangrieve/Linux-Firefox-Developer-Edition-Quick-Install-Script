# Linux-Firefox-Developer-Edition-Quick-Install-Script

A simple shell script that installs the latest version of Firefox Developer Edition for Linux. It downloads the latest version from Mozilla's servers, extracts it to /opt/firefox-developer-edition, creates a start menu launcher for it, and removes the downloaded archive. To use the script, save it to a file with a .sh extension, make it executable using chmod +x, and run it in a terminal.
